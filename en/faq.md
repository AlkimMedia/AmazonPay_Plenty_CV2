## The Amazon Pay button is disabled in the frontend. What can I do?

A disabled button means that the Amazon Pay account is not active and approved.

**Possible causes:**

1. A fresh account has not yet been activated because documents are missing
2. The "JavaScript origin" is not correctly entered

If none of this has helped you, please contact Amazon Pay or our [Support](mailto:info@alkim.de) providing your Amazon Pay Merchant ID.
