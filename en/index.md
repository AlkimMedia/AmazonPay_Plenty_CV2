##Payment process
An Amazon Pay payment consists of two parts: An authorisation and the actual payment collection. This gives you
the option of not collecting the payment until it is shipped, as Amazon Pay guarantees the successful
collection for a certain period of time. Nevertheless, it is advantageous to collect the payment immediately, as it may otherwise be necessary for the

You have a variety of options in the plugin settings to set the payment process that suits you best.

#### Refund of Amazon Pay payment

In order to refund customers a payment in the case of a credit note, e.g. in the case of a return, you could use this event procedure

initiates a refund in the amount of the credit memo you created.
