If you have already installed another version of Amazon Pay and would like to migrate to the new plugin, we recommend the following steps:

1. Remove all container links and shop builder elements of the old plugin. The plugin is then no longer visible in the shop frontend.
2. Install and set up the new plugin.
3. When all orders paid with the old plugin have been fully processed and you are sure that no refunds or other transactions are necessary, you can completely uninstall it and remove any event procedures.
